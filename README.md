# kissinstaller
https://k1ss.org  
This will be will be an installer for k1ss linux. Still need to do some probing into the project however.

## goals
Priorities:
1. ~~Wayland + some wm manager~~ nope! Well... maybe: https://github.com/dilyn-corner/KISS-kde this really is an interesting approach.
2. Media: mpv / svix / w3m / cmus / ranger combo
3. Wireless: wpa_sup + wg
4. Big Apps: Firefox / ~~Krita / Blender~~ / Latex
5. ~~Games: Enough to run renpy or simple unity apps (wine?)~~

Lost a lot of priorities after reading the k1ss site more deeply... Still I like the philosophy.
