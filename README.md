# kissinstaller
https://k1ss.org  
This will be will be an installer for k1ss linux. Still need to do some probing into the project however.

## goals
Priorities:
1. ~~Wayland + some wm manager~~ nope! Well... maybe: https://github.com/dilyn-corner/KISS-kde this really is an interesting approach.
    https://github.com/kisslinux/wiki/blob/master/wayland/install-wayland.txt
2. Media: mpv / svix / w3m / cmus / ranger combo
3. Wireless: wpa_sup + wg
4. Big Apps: Firefox / Krita / Blender / Latex
    - krita: https://github.com/dilyn-corner/KISS-kde/tree/master/kde/krita
    - blender: pending
    - Latex: https://www.reddit.com/r/kisslinux/comments/i2x7bn/who_uses_kiss_linux/g1k9clb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
5. ~~Games: Enough to run renpy or simple unity apps (wine?)~~

~~Lost a lot of priorities after reading the k1ss site more deeply... Still~~ I like the philosophy.
